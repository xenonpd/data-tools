Use INDIRECT to dynamically refer to worksheets in Excel and Google Spreadsheets

Sometimes you want to make a reference to certain worksheets dynamically. For example if you have data in the same format split over multiple worksheets and you want to select data from different sheets dynamically. In this case, you can use the INDIRECT() function, which is available in both Excel and Google Spreadsheets.
